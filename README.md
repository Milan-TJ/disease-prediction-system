## Ticket 1 — Data Collection & EDA

**Owner:** Milan TJ (lead), Nandana Venugopal, Sona Santhosh | **Completed:** 01 Jul 2026

### Datasets

**Primary:** [Disease Prediction Using Machine Learning](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/kaushil268/disease-prediction-using-machine-learning) (kaushil268, Kaggle)
4,920 records · 132 binary symptom features · 41 disease labels

**Supplementary:** [Disease Symptom Description Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/itachi9604/disease-symptom-description-dataset) (itachi9604, Kaggle)
Disease descriptions, precautions, and symptom severity weights — mapped to all 41 diseases and 132 symptoms. Used to enrich the GenAI prompt layer.

### Pipeline

1. **Schema Validation** — confirmed 132 symptom columns + 1 target; removed spurious trailing empty column (`Unnamed: 133`) present in raw export.
2. **Cleaning** — 0 nulls after column drop; all 132 features validated as clean binary 0/1; 4,616 duplicate rows identified (dataset is balanced at 120 rows/disease but only 304 truly unique symptom-combinations exist — documented for Ticket 2 overfitting check).
3. **Encoding** — `prognosis` label-encoded via `sklearn.LabelEncoder`; mapping saved to `disease_label_mapping.csv` for reuse in inference.
4. **NLP Preprocessing** — symptom column names normalised into natural-language phrases (e.g. `burning_micturition` → "burning micturition"); per-record `symptom_text` field generated as a GenAI prompt template.
5. **EDA** — 7 visualisations produced covering disease frequency, symptom co-occurrence heatmap, top symptoms, disease share pie chart, word cloud, average symptoms per disease, and severity distribution.

### Key Findings

- High-frequency symptoms (fatigue, vomiting, high fever, headache) appear across many diseases — supports ensemble models over linear ones.
- Jaundice-cluster symptoms (`yellowish_skin`, `dark_urine`, `yellowing_of_eyes`) show strong co-occurrence in the heatmap.
- Average symptom count varies noticeably by disease — Hepatitis family presents with fewer, more specific symptoms; Gastroenteritis and Typhoid present broader clusters.

### Outputs

| File | Description |
|---|---|
| `data/Training_cleaned.csv` | Full cleaned training set with encoding + symptom_text |
| `data/Training_dedup.csv` | 304 unique rows for overfitting comparison |
| `data/Testing_cleaned.csv` | Cleaned 42-row test set |
| `data/disease_label_mapping.csv` | LabelEncoder class ↔ integer mapping |
| `data/symptom_Description.csv` | Disease descriptions (41 diseases) |
| `data/symptom_precaution.csv` | 4 precautions per disease (41 diseases) |
| `data/Symptom-severity.csv` | Severity weight per symptom (132 symptoms, scale 1–7) |

## Ticket 2 — Model Development & GenAI Integration

**Owner:** Milan TJ (lead), Ajul ND, Sona Santhosh | **Completed:** 08 Jul 2026

### Model Results

| Model | Val Acc | Test Acc | Val F1 | Test F1 | CV Mean | ROC-AUC |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| Decision Tree | 1.0000 | 0.9762 | 1.0000 | 0.9837 | 0.9995 | 0.9936 |
| Random Forest | 1.0000 | 0.9762 | 1.0000 | 0.9837 | 1.0000 | 1.0000 |
| **Bernoulli NB** ✅ | **1.0000** | **1.0000** | **1.0000** | **1.0000** | **1.0000** | **1.0000** |
| SVM (RBF) | 1.0000 | 1.0000 | 1.0000 | 1.0000 | 1.0000 | 1.0000 |
| XGBoost | 1.0000 | 0.9762 | 1.0000 | 0.9837 | 0.9995 | 1.0000 |

**Selected Model: Bernoulli NB** — 100% test accuracy, perfect macro F1 and ROC-AUC, smallest serialised size (88 KB), fastest inference. Ideal for Flask deployment.

> **Overfitting check (deduplicated dataset):** Decision Tree drops to 59% F1 on unique symptom-combinations; Random Forest and SVM hold at 100%, confirming genuine generalisation rather than row memorisation. `random_forest.pkl` is included in the Flask app as a secondary option.

### Pipeline

1. Stratified 80/20 train/val split on full training data; Kaggle `Testing.csv` used as final held-out set.
2. Benchmarked on both full (4,920 rows) and deduplicated (304 rows) datasets.
3. 5-fold cross-validation on all models.
4. ROC-AUC computed via One-vs-Rest (OvR) multi-class approach.
5. Feature importance extracted from Random Forest and XGBoost for documentation.

### GenAI Integration

`get_recipe_recommendation(disease, symptoms)` builds a structured prompt enriched with disease description, precautions, and a computed severity score (average symptom weight from `Symptom-severity.csv`), then calls **Gemini 2.0 Flash** via the `google-genai` SDK to generate a personalised dietary recipe and lifestyle recommendations.

```python
# SDK: google-genai (not the deprecated google-generativeai)
from google import genai
client = genai.Client(api_key=GEMINI_API_KEY)
response = client.models.generate_content(
    model='gemini-3.1-flash-lite',
    contents=prompt,
)
```

Set `GEMINI_API_KEY` as an environment variable or directly in the notebook. Falls back to a structured mock response if quota is exhausted or key is not set. Get a free API key at [aistudio.google.com/apikey](https://aistudio.google.com/apikey).

### Outputs

| File | Description |
|---|---|
| `models/best_model.pkl` | Serialised Bernoulli NB model |
| `models/*.pkl` | All 5 trained models |
| `models/symptom_cols.json` | Ordered 132-feature list for inference |
| `models/disease_label_mapping.csv` | Encoded label ↔ disease name |
| `models/model_metadata.json` | Full metrics, model name, class names |
| `models/pipeline.py` | Importable prediction + GenAI recommendation pipeline |
| `notebooks/outputs/classification_report.csv` | Per-class precision/recall/F1 |

## Ticket 3 — Model Optimization & Flask Deployment

### Optimization

The final Disease Prediction System was optimized for deployment by selecting the best-performing model (Bernoulli Naive Bayes) based on accuracy, inference speed, and model size.

Optimization steps performed:

1. Selected the Bernoulli Naive Bayes model as the production model.
2. Saved the trained model using Joblib for efficient loading.
3. Stored symptom columns and disease label mappings separately for inference.
4. Reduced inference time by loading all resources only once during application startup.
5. Integrated the Google Gemini API to generate disease-specific health, diet, recipe, and lifestyle recommendations.

### Flask Web Application

The trained model was deployed using the Flask framework.

The web application provides:

- Selection of one or more symptoms using checkboxes.
- Disease prediction using the trained Machine Learning model.
- Prediction confidence score.
- Top 3 predicted diseases with confidence values.
- Disease description.
- Recommended precautions.
- AI-generated health, diet, recipe, and lifestyle recommendations using Gemini.
- Display of the symptoms selected by the user.

### Application Workflow

1. User selects symptoms.
2. Flask receives the selected symptoms.
3. Symptoms are converted into a binary feature vector.
4. The Bernoulli Naive Bayes model predicts the disease.
5. Prediction probabilities are calculated.
6. Disease description and precautions are retrieved from the dataset.
7. Gemini generates personalized dietary recommendations.
8. Results are displayed on the web interface.

### Outputs

| File | Description |
|---|---|
| `app.py` | Flask application entry point |
| `predictor.py` | Prediction pipeline and Gemini integration |
| `templates/home.html` | Symptom selection page |
| `templates/result.html` | Prediction results page |
| `static/style.css` | Application styling |
| `.env` | Stores Gemini API key (excluded from Git) |
| `requirements.txt` | Python dependencies |
